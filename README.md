# taco
a taco logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!).

### Taco Time
This is a taco creator that allows the user to devour the taco afterwards. The app is handled with node and express. Handlebars is used for the templating system to generate HTML and a homemade ORM to interact with SQL.

### How to use Taco Time
One can add a taco by filling out the input form and hitting submit. This will add a taco to the tacos list on the left. If you click devour, ti will eat the taco and move it to the right as disabled.

### How to run the program
you can go to : https://thawing-badlands-99892.herokuapp.com/

or clone the repo `taco`, clone the repo, `npm install` all the node dependencies and host it on our own node server. You will need to add the SQL schema to initialize the database.
